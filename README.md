## Homework and Bonus completed

I am submitting two excel files, two VBA scripts, and three screen shots of the solutions from the multi year stock data excel file.  

* The code took me aproximately 3-4 minutes to run on my  Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm file. And less than one minute to run on my alphabetical_test.xlsm file.

## Files

* [Stock Data Solved](excel_files/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm) 

* [Alphabet Data Solved](excel_files/alphabetical_test.xlsm) 

## VBA Scripts

* [My VBA Script](VBA_scripts/HWSolution.bas) - This is my code for solving the homework and bonus part.
* [My VBA Script](VBA_scripts/Resetscript.bas) - This code was for reseting the excel sheets and erasing the solutions in case it was needed.  
## Screen Shots 

*  3 screen shots for each year of my results on the Multi Year Stock Data.
